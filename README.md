# CodingNamingConvention

# Why Naming Convention in the software code?
[Naming Convention from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming))

# What is the CodingNamingConvention?
The utility takes care of naming convention automatically in the script you wish to implement naming convention. I have uploaded a document named Test Write Handbook. Please 
see the naming convention in the word document suites your project. If it is then you can directly use this Utility

#How to Use
1. Keep the 3 files in the same path.
2. Run the CodingNamingConventionSolver.mac(.mac is the extenion of .net file in the mbtech tool) which will prompt for input file in which you wish to implement naming convention.
Provide your input file. It will fix it in less than 5 seconds(depends upon size of the input file)

#Otherways to use this Utility
1. You can reuse the code for your project needs. I have added sufficient comments.

Flow
CodingNamingConventionSolver.mac - Run it.
